/**
 * FUNCTIONS
 * ==============================
 *
 * This function is usefull in combination with z-index and lists.
 * It checks that we are requesting something that exists in the list. If the value exists, 
 * then it returns the result of the index call, just like before. If the value does not exist, 
 * then two things happen:
 * 	1. A warning is printed telling you that the item youâ€™re requesting is not in the list, 
 *    	and the values of the list are printed so that you can see what to choose from.
 * 	2. The value returned is null, which tells Sass not to print out the rule at all.
