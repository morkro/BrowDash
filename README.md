# BrowDash
A simple and customisable "new tab" Chrome extension using Google Material Design.

### Goals

Having a full customisable dashboard with a set of different modules (cards) using bleeding edge technologies and Googles material design. The user can create new cards, change the order and theme of each card as well as the entire dashboards theme and delete cards.

### Available cards (first draft)

- A basic one. Saves simple text

### Planned cards

- Weather card (uses current location but should be optional)
- Notifications card (like setting personal alarm messages)
- Todo list card
- Device statistics (like battery status and more)

### Technologies

- All currently implemented/available ES6 features in Chrome
- localStorage API
- Device API's
- Web Components (HTML imports, Custom Elements)

# How to use

BrowDash is currently still in heavy development and not even alpha. As soon as a first beta is available to download, I'll will let you know.
